- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
    I've learned about inheritance previously so I had no new initial impressions.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    Things worked pretty much smoothly except the 'super' calls in constructors. Since we didn't work much with Building directly, it made it more difficult to tell how a house, library, or cafe should work as buildings.
